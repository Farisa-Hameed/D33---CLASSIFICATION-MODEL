# D33---CLASSIFICATION-MODEL
This project uses the Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn to classify tumors as malignant or benign. After preprocessing (scaling features), five classifiers—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and k-NN—were implemented. Logistic Regression performed best (97.37% accuracy), highlighting its effectiveness for this task.
