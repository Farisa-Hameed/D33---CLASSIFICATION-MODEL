# D33---CLASSIFICATION-MODEL
This project applies supervised learning techniques to classify tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn. 
The workflow includes preprocessing (checking for missing values and scaling features) and implementing five classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and k-NN. Models were compared based on accuracy, with Logistic Regression achieving the highest accuracy (97.37%) and Decision Tree and k-NN tying for the lowest (94.74%). 
This comparison underscores the importance of preprocessing and selecting appropriate models for optimal performance.
